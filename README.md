# Roblox-Py-Screen-Render
Resource for rendering screen in roblox studio (locally)

- Place lua code into a server script
- Load rbxm file into studio and place in workspace (or if you know what you're doing, change code to fit your needs)
- Run python code
- Play test game in roblox studio
- Low res image of your display should show up on the "Screen" in studio

Notes:
- Only works locally on host computer, though you could probably extend its functionality through port forwarding
- Python code must be running (aka web server must be active) for it to work
